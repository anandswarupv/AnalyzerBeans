/**
 * A dictionary represents a set of values grouped together with a label.
 * 
 * Examples of meaningful dictionaries:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Lastnames</li>
 * <li>Female given names</li>
 * <li>Product codes</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Often times a dictionary will implement a caching mechanism to prevent having
 * to hold all values of the dictionary in memory.
 * 
 * A dictionary can have methods annotated with @Initialize and @Close. These
 * will be called before and after a job is executed where the given dictionary
 * is used.
 * 
 * Note: Dictionaries should be thread-safe!! Make sure to make sensible use of
 * synchronized blocks if there are race conditions in the dictionary
 * implementation.
