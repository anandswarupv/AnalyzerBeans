/**
 * Classes that are annotated with the @AnalyzerBean annotation are components
 * for data analysis. All @AnalyzerBean classes must implement {@link Analyzer}.
 * 
 * The life-cycle of an AnalyzerBean is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Instantiation. All AnalyzerBeans need to provide a no-args constructor.</li>
 * <li>All methods or fields with the @Configured annotation are
 * invoked/assigned to configure the AnalyzerBean before execution.</li>
 * <li>All methods or fields with the @Provided annotation are invoked/assigned</li>
 * <li>Any no-args methods with the @Initialize annotation are executed.</li>
 * <li>The {@link Analyzer#run(org.eobjects.analyzer.data.InputRow, int)} method is
 * called for each row in the analyzed DataSet.</li>
 * <li>All methods with the @Result annotation are invoked to retrieve the
 * result.</li>
 * <li>Any no-args methods with the @Close annotation are invoked if the
 * analyzer needs to release any resources.</li>
 * <li>If the analyzer implements the java.io.Closeable interface, the close()
 * method is also invoked.</li>
 * <li>The AnalyzerBean object is dereferenced and garbage collected</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * AnalyzerBeans are by default only invoked by a single thread at a time. This
 * behaviour can be overridden by using the @Concurrent annotation.
