/**
 * A row processing analyzer is a component that recieves rows of data and
 * produces some sort of result from it.
 * 
 * The run(InputRow, int) method will be invoked on the analyzer for each row in
 * a configured datastore. To retrieve the values from the row InputColumn
 * instances must be used as qualifiers. These InputColumns needs to be injected
 * (either a single instance or an array) using the @Configured annotation. If
 * no @Configured InputColumns are found in the class, the analyzer will not be
 * able to execute.
 * 
 * Use of the @AnalyzerBean annotation is required for analyzers in order to be
 * automatically discovered.
